<!--
## Installation
```bash
npm install fhirpath-jotai
```
-->

## Usage

```tsx
import { atom } from 'jotai';
import { expressionAtom } from 'fhirpath-jotai';

const heightAtom = atom(180);
const weightAtom = atom(80);

const bmiExpressionAtom = expressionAtom('%weight / (%height/100).power(2)', {
  weight: weightAtom,
  height: heightAtom,
});
```

## Granular updates ðŸŽ¯

The `expressionAtom` will only update when the values it depends on change. This means that if you have multiple expressions that depend on the same atoms, only the expressions that are affected by the change will update.
